# Crypto-Alert

First of All, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this repo.

So when I started looking out tutorials for the Electron Js, almost all tutorials were old(i.e 2017 would you believe that?) based on outdated ElectronJs versions.

When I started implementing [DesignCourse's Learn Electron in Less than 60 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RxHQoiDctI&t=1859s) tutorial lot of things didn't worked because of version differences.

Finally after scratching my head and looking out documentations and ofcourse StackOverflow, I made it working with the latest Electron Js version i.e 13.

You don't believe me? Check the screenshot.
