# Crypto-Alert - Learn Electron in Less than 60 Minutes - Free Beginner's Course

Well If you are here than I would like to welcome you. 

So when I started looking out tutorials for the Electron Js, almost all tutorials were old(i.e 2017) and based on outdated ElectronJs versions.
When I started implementing [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RxHQoiDctI&t=1859s) tutorial and it didn't work because of the old versions.

Finally after scratching my head and looking out documentations and ofcourse StackOverflow, I made it work with the latest ElectronJs(13).

You don't believe me? Check the screenshot.
